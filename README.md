### - Which browser are we using for this course ?
We shall be using the latest version of Chrome as of today. Be sure to install/update Chrome on your computer.

### - How do I open Chrome Browser in Mobile View ?

### - How do I run Application In Browser?
To run the app in the development mode,
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
We are using Chrome Developer console in this course.



### - How to view changes on UI after editing code ?
Here are few ways to do so:

1) Run the app in Chrome developer console by using the below URL.
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) 
The page will reload if you make edits and you will also see any lint errors in the console.

2) You can open the app on your phone Chrome browser by using the IP Address from your console. 
For example after you run `npm start`, you will see the following on your terminal.
```$xslt
You can now view app in the browser.

  Local:            http://localhost:3000/
  On Your Network:  http://192.161.3.10:3000/

Note that the development build is not optimized.
To create a production build, use npm run build.
```

Open Chrome on your phone and hit this URL:
[http://192.161.3.10:3000](http://192.161.3.10:3000)

# Module 02 - Project Set up and Code Walkthrough

# Module 03 - Audit and Debug App Installability

```sh
git checkout module03_debug_app_install
```

## Notes: 

### - *Automatic browser promotion not available in Chrome incognito window*   
In Chrome's incognito window, PWA app install prompt does not work. In private mode, there is no way browser can get the information about already installed apps so it doesn't know whether or not the app user is browsing has been installed. Hence it does not show install prompt. 
[Here is the reference](https://wicg.github.io/get-installed-related-apps/spec/#privacy-considerations) in W3C for privacy considerations.
